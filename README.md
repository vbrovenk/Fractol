# Fractol
This project is a small fractal exploration program.
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. 
They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

### Install and run

git clone fract
